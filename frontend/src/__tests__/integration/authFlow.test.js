/**
 * Integration tests for the authentication flow
 * 
 * This test suite is intended to test the complete authentication process
 * including user registration, login, token handling, and authentication state management.
 * 
 * Unlike unit tests that focus on individual components in isolation,
 * these integration tests will verify that multiple components and services
 * work together correctly to provide the complete authentication experience.
 * 
 * TODO: Implement the following integration tests:
 * - User registration flow (signup form submission → API call → state update)
 * - Login flow (login form submission → API call → JWT storage → state update)
 * - Two-factor authentication (if applicable)
 * - Password reset flow
 * - Token persistence between page reloads
 * - Authentication state affecting UI (navbar, protected routes)
 * - Logout flow (clearing tokens and state)
